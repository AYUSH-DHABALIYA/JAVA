Q. What is Normalization ?

- Normalization is used to reduce redundancy from database.

- Normalization divides the large and lengthy tables into small tabels and make them connected to relation database.

- Benefits of normalization is decrease usage of memory, convert large data into small data, reduce redundancy in the database.

- Normalization works through different stage or we can say different series called Normal forms.

- There are different types of normal forms.

- Following are the various types of Normal forms : 
     
     => 1 NF 
     => 2 NF
     => 3 NF
     => BCNF ( Boycee Codd's Normal form)
     => 4 NF
     => 5 NF

=> 1NF - 1NF is basic level of normalization.
      - each table should contain single value.
      - and each column should be contain unqiue value.
      - this used to eliminate duplicate data form the table.

=> 2NF - 2NF is reduce =redundancy from database.
       - In 2NF, in table every non-primary key column is depend on primary key on the individual table.
       - In 2NF primary key  is neccessary.
       - All non-primary key is depend on primary key.

=> 3NF - 3NF is builds on 2NF and every non-primary key attribute is independent of each other.
       - every non-primary key attribute is directly depend on primary key on that table.

=> BCNF - Boycee Codd's Normal form is very stricter than 3NF.
        - it's only allow candidate key.
        - it means every non-primary key is only depend on candidate key.

=> 4NF - 4NF is not allow any mutli-valued dependencies.

=> 5NF - 5NF is highest level of normalization.
       - it converts large tables into smaller tables.
       - 5NF increase the intergrity of the database compare to other normal form.
