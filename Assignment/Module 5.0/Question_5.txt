Q. What do you understand By Data Redundancy?

- Redundancy means having multiples data in database.

- this occurs when database is not normalised.

- Data redundancy can occur by accident but is also done for backup and recovery purposes.

- Redundant data costs extra money, requires higher storage, and requires extra time to keep all the files in database as same as they are.

- somwtimes it's hard for user to work due to redundant data.

- redundancy makes database harder and time consuming because of multiple data and same data in same database.

- redundancy also create huge problem in cae of storage in database, more redundancy means more storage required to store data.

- problem occur when you've to update, delete, or insert any data to database.

- it quite time taking and slow compare to other because of duplicate data.

- anomaly insertion is occured, this means when you want to  insert any data but you can't insert that data in database.

- same as anomaly deleting, anomaly updatating.

- this are disadvantages of redundancy.

- but only advantage in redundancy is secure data and data backup.
